# MATH 271
Collection of my notes in Professor Charles Roth's MATH 271 "Linear Algebra and Partial Differential Equations" course at McGill. Taken in F2024. Both the .tex code and rendered PDFs can be found in their respective folders.

MATH 271 is an advanced math course taken exclusively by Mechanical Engineering majors at McGill. It roughly covers boundary value problems of various forms of the Diffusion, Wave, and Laplace's equations alongside aspects of advanced linear algebra. The official course outline is as such:

**1. Partial Differential Equations**  
The derivations of the fundamental partial differential equations governing engineering systems: fluid flow, diffusion of heat and steady state temperature distribution, electromagnetic theory and vibrations. Poisson (Laplace), Diffusion, Wave equations, Boundary conditions, uniqueness of solutions, solutions of boundary value problems using Fourier series.

**2. Linear Algebra**  
Vector spaces, inner product spaces, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, Hermitian operators, Fourier expansions.

**3. Sturm-Liouville Theory**  
Applications and solutions of boundary value problems in spherical and cylindrical coordinates, Legendre polynomials and Bessel functions, generalizations.

~~**4. Linear Systems of Ordinary Differential and Difference Equations**~~ (Removed after credit load was reduced from 4 to 3)     
~~Solutions by eigenvalues and eigenvectors, as well as by diagonalization. Cayley-Hamilton theorem, functions of matrices, e<sup>AT</sup>. The exponential matrix method, solution by elimination. Applications particularly to systems of vibrating mass.~~

My notes are split into five sections, as outlined below. Every section below has a corresponding PDF and .tex file (or will have, once I finish transcribing and uploading them). The subsections outlined here are also consistent with the subsections found in the PDF and .tex files.

*NB: The majority of the notes were written by hand (Goodnotes) and then transcribed into LaTeX through the use of automated software. Although I did attempt to manually correct any errors in the transcription, it is possible that I have missed some. Figures may also be missing. If you want a copy of the original handwritten notes, create a pull request with your email and desired sections and I will send it to you. I am also human. I may have made mistakes, applied unsound logic, and omitted material. When in doubt, consult with the professor or TAs*
