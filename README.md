# MATH 271
Collection of my notes in Professor Charles Roth's MATH 271 "Linear Algebra and Partial Differential Equations" course at McGill. Taken in F2024. Both the .tex code and rendered PDFs can be found in their respective folders.

MATH 271 is an advanced math course taken exclusively by Mechanical Engineering majors at McGill. It roughly covers boundary value problems of various forms of the Diffusion, Wave, and Laplace's equations alongside aspects of advanced linear algebra. As we were not provided with a course outline, here is one from a previous semester. 

I. Vector spaces, inner product spaces. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operators and matrices, Hermitian operators and matrices. Fourier expansions and Fourier series. Least-squares regression analysis. The Cayley-Hamilton theorem, functions of matrices, eAt.

II. Linear systems of Ordinary Differential and Difference Equations: Review of solutions by eigenvalues and eigenvectors as well as by diagonalization. The exponential and fundamental matrix methods. Solution by elimination.

III. Partial Differential Equations: Review of Laplace, diffusion and wave equations in engineering systems, boundary conditions, uniqueness of solutions, solutions of boundary value problems using Fourier series.

IV. Sturm-Liouville Theory: Applications to solutions of boundary value problems in spherical and cylindrical coordinates, generalizations. Legendre polynomials and Bessel functions. 

The aforementioned topics were not closely followed in my semester- nor were they in the listed order. I have thus attempted to make a more accurate outline pertaining to the subjects and topics covered. Every "chapter" in this outline has a corresponding set of notes (or will so, once I finish transcribing and uploading them).

1. **Partial Differential Equations in Engineering** 
2. **Boundary Value Problems**
3. **Inner Product Spaces**
4. **Linear Algebra**
5. **Sturm-Liouville Boundary Value Problems**

*NB: The majority of the notes were written by hand (Goodnotes) and then transcribed into LaTeX through the use of automated software. Although I did attempt to manually correct any errors in the transcription, it is possible that I have missed some. Figures may also be missing. If you want a copy of the original handwritten notes, create a pull request with your email and desired sections and I will send it to you.*
